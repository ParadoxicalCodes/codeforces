# Attempt 1
First I was stumped as to how will I access a letter/pos inside an array of a particular element. After some googling i was presented with two ways either use a ptr or initialise str as an 2D array.

> Issue here is malloc tbh i dont understand what happened here? the only issue i *understand* is not writing strr(i) in my scanf when reading words

# Attempt 2

This time i used the 2D array method for my str array
> issue this time is incorrect logic i didnt read question properly. Word length of 10 wont be shortened but my code is doing that exactly, len<=10 is correct

# Attempt 3 (Success!)

Now here i am confused as to how the second pair brackets containing my position/letters of the word is initialised??
GPTing my query gave me the following:-

I kind of get what it says, but unfamiliar territotry so not confident with the explanation. Need to look into this later.
