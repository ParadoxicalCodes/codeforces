the len doesnt count "distinct" characters it counts every character regardless whether its distinct or not hence the issue

I tried to have the same string be compared to itself and check for matches, once a match occurs len decreases by 1. But I dont understand why this is wrong?
It seems it counts duplicates to and so decreases more than intended.
